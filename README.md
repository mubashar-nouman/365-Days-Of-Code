# Welcome to the 365 Days of Code repository! #

This repository is for anyone who is participating in the 365 Days of Code challenge. The goal of this challenge is to code for at least an hour every day for 365 days. This can be any type of coding, including working on personal projects, contributing to open source projects, or going through online tutorials and courses.

Here's how to get started:

* Fork this repository to your own GitHub account.
* Create a new folder of your name.(In case the name already exist, write (2) with your name.
* Each day, create a new file in the days directory with the format DD_MM_YYYY.md, where DD_MM_YYYY is the current date.
* Inside a file, write a comment on top, explaining the title of your code
* In the file, write a brief summary of what you did that day. This could include the coding projects you worked on, the resources you used, and any challenges or accomplishments.
* Commit and push your changes to your forked repository.
* At the end of each week, create a new pull request to merge the changes into the main repository.
* That's it! You're now participating in the 365 Days of Code challenge. Remember to keep your daily entries brief, and to focus on what you learned rather than how much you accomplished.
